# Prerequisites
Latest version of Python 3!:

    To check if you have the right version of python3 run this command:
    
        python3 --version
    
    If you don't have it installed run this command:
    
        sudo apt-get install python3.6
    
Latest version of Pygame:
    
    To check if you have pygame installed run this:
    
        python3 -m pygame.examples.aliens
    
    If nothing runs then you need to download pygame using this command:
    
        python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user


# What do you mean by Tetris???
This is a side project of mine I made to learn python3 as well as the pygame module. Simply put it is just a bare bones clone of Tetris.

# What are the controls of the game??
The controls are pretty simple:
    
    Up-Key:     Rotate Tetrimino
    Down-Key:   Fall Faster
    Left-Key:   Move left one unit
    Right-Key:  Move Right one unit

# That's cool how do I play it???
Also just as simple!! If you have downloaded the prerequsites then all you must do is travel into the directory and run this:
    
    python3 tetris.py
    
That's all there is too it!! If you got this far into the README or played the game I thank you, I hope you enjoyed my code as much as I did making it.
